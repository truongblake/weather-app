# Weather App

A simple Weather App built with **ReactJS**, created to learn the basics of web development, data fetching, and working with APIs. This project utilizes the **OpenWeatherAPI** to retrieve real-time weather data for specified cities or locations.

## Project Timeline

Developed in **October 2024**, this project focused on:
- **React Basics**: Building components, managing state, and understanding React’s core architecture.
- **API Integration**: Learning to fetch JSON data from an external API and handle asynchronous requests.
- **Data Rendering**: Parsing and displaying structured data from an API in a user-friendly format.

## Features
- **Current Weather Data**: Displays current temperature, weather conditions, and other relevant data for a specified location.
- **City Search**: Users can enter a city name to get up-to-date weather information.
- **Dynamic Interface**: Reactively updates the display based on the fetched data from OpenWeatherAPI.

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run the project locally:

**Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/truongblake/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
```
Install dependencies:

    npm install

Obtain an API Key:

Visit OpenWeatherAPI to sign up and get a free API key.
Add your API key to the project’s environment variables or directly within the API fetch call in the code.

Run the application:

    npm start

Access the app: Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

Learning Outcome

Through building this project, I improved my skills in:

React Development: Practiced component creation, state management, and rendering in React.
Data Fetching and JSON Parsing: Learned to make asynchronous API calls, handle JSON responses, and map data to user-facing components.
Error Handling: Added basic error handling for API calls to manage issues like invalid city names or network errors.
